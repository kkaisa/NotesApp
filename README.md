# NotesApp simple REST API 

Site link: Coming soon...

#### With a notes app, you can create and store any of your notes for later use.

### Basic Features

#### User should be able to register an account, log in and create, edit, and delete a note.

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API
> - .NET Core
> - MVC Architectural Pattern
> - C#

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - Dependency injection
> - JWT
> - Entity Framework Core O/RM (DBContext, Migration)
> - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) & AutoMapper
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)
> - Docker (Container, Image, Deploying on Docker Hub)
> - Microsoft Azure (Deployment: Docker Image + Postgres Database)
>
