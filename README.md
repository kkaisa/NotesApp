# NotesApp simple REST API 

#### With a notes app, you can create and store any of your notes for later use.

### Basic Features

#### User should be able to register an account, log in and create, edit, and delete a note.

Site link: Coming soon...

#### All the classes and layers are definitely not necessary for this simple app. The purpose of this project is to train how to think abstractly, in generic terms and in long-term.

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - Building a REST API
> - .NET Core
> - MVC Architectural Pattern
> - C#

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - Dependency injection
> - JWT
> - Entity Framework Core O/RM (DBContext, Migration)
> - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) & AutoMapper
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)
> - Docker (Container, Image, Deploying on Docker Hub)
> - Microsoft Azure (Deployment: Docker Image + Postgres Database)
> 
> ### Swagger:
